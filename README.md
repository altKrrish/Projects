AMSdbGPT: AI-Powered SQL Generation and Data Analysis Tool

Role: Lead Developer, Architect

Technologies Used: Python, Streamlit, Google Gemini API, SQL Server (T-SQL), SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Plotly, Docker (optional)

Description: AMSdbGPT is a full-stack, AI-powered conversational data analysis tool. Built from scratch, it allows business users to generate complex T-SQL queries and visualize data simply by asking questions in plain English. The application leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to interpret natural language, convert it into optimized SQL, and display the results in an interactive interface. It was designed to democratize data access and reduce the dependency on technical teams for routine data requests.

Key Accomplishments:
Architected and developed a robust prompt engineering framework that translates user questions into highly optimized and production-ready T-SQL, adhering to strict business logic and performance standards.

Integrated the Google Gemini API to enable seamless natural language processing, resulting in accurate SQL generation and a user-friendly conversational experience.

Designed and implemented a modular Streamlit front-end that provides real-time chat, interactive data tables, and dynamic charting, significantly enhancing the user experience.

Created a dynamic schema management system that automatically ingests database metadata, ensuring the LLM has up-to-date context for all tables, columns, and relationships.

Incorporated essential business logic and rules directly into the system prompt, including fiscal year calculations, specific metric formulas, and data exclusion filters, to ensure consistent and reliable results.
